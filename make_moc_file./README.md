Shell script calc_moc.sc calculates the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) and Heat Transport. It calls calculate_msf_cesm.f and also needs the following files: 

in_depths.42.dat 
topography_200709.ieeei4
basin_mask_kmt.atl
basin_mask_kmt.indopac
horiz_grid_200709.ieeer8
dzbc_pbc_s2.0_200709.ieeer8

Unfortunately the last 5 files were too big (> 25MB)  to add to GitHub.
However they are the initial files for the POP model with which you generated the POP data so you should have them.
