Contains the files that are needed to calculate the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) and Heat Transport. Unfortunately the following files are needed too but they were too big (> 25MB)  to add to GitHub:

topography_200709.ieeei4
basin_mask_kmt.atl
basin_mask_kmt.indopac
horiz_grid_200709.ieeer8
dzbc_pbc_s2.0_200709.ieeer8

However they are the initial files for the POP model with which you generated the POP data so you should have them
